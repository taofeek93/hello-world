# hello-world
First ever Github content via CodeAcademy Premium bootcamp. 
My name is Taofeek, I am from Nigeria, emigrated to the U.S in 2008. I work as an IT Asset Analyst at Comcast. I signed up for this program for a few reasons, such as building skills to apply to my work, build up enough competency to be able to create my own projects i.e a listener engagement app for my podcast, a sport pickup games app, etc
